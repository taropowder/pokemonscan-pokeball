## quick start 

### INSTALL

#### Server 

download `server.zip`

```bash
unzip server.zip
```

Three files will be extracted
- docker-compose.yml
- install.sh
- openssl.cnf

Execute the installation script

```bash
bash install.sh
```

Observe the output of the installation script, and finally the log will be output
```
success init admin user : password xxxxxxxxxx
```

At this time, a new default account admin is created, and the password is as above. If you forget the password, read the secret field of daycare_config.yml in the config directory

Visit http://ip:2314 If it can be accessed normally, the installation is successful
